Basically what I want to create is a CMS that would have this features

- Project approach: the ability to have in one install multiple projects
- Inport/Export: an easy to use inport export for projects, tables and certain rows
- Content optimization: have a good fine tuning for fields to allow easy content optimization and formatting
- Content generation: every field would have a description, so that it can propt an LLM like gpt to generate content directly into the CMS
- Content planning: the ability to plan the content that you want to publish ahead of time, with the possibility to generate it
- Content propagation: the ability to connect social networks to publish your content into different channels
- Webhooks: the ability to fetch content directly from the cms on actions or by using crons
